# Minecraft Biome Identifier With NVIDIA
A machine learning model that identifies the minecraft biome based on an image. <br/><br/>
Biomes include:
- badlands
- basalt_deltas
- crimson_forest
- dark_forest
- desert
- jungle
- nether_wastes
- oak_forest
- ocean
- plains
- savanna
- soul_sand_valley
- taiga
- warped_forest

## The Algorithm
The Minecraft Biome Identifier uses the resnet18 image recognition model retrained for the specific purpose of identifying biomes. The data images used to train, test and validate the model comes from two kaggle databases:
>[Minecraft Dimensions Screenshots by PR1M3R](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pr1m3r/minecraft-dimensions-screenshots?resource=download) <br/>
>[Minecraft Biomes by WILLOW C](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/willowc/minecraft-biomes?resource=download)
